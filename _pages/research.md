## Interests

My current interests are centered around:

- **Algebraic geometry** (learning-focused; currently building foundations)
- **Number theory and cryptography**

## Current Work

- Undergraduate research with [Mahir Bilen Can](https://www2.tulane.edu/~mcan/) (Tulane University)

## Projects and Write-ups

I use the Projects/Portfolio section to collect longer write-ups and technical projects.
