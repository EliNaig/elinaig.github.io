**Hello!** I'm Eli Naig, a mathematics student at Tulane University who sees math as more than a subject, it's the lens through which I uncover patterns in everything, from the physics of climbing ropes to the geometry of ski slopes. Like Feynman, I'm driven by the urgency of discovery: *"I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there."*  

## Why Math?  

To me, mathematics is:  
- 🔍 A language of abstract beauty and real-world impact  
- 🌐 The framework connecting algebraic geometry's schemes to tangible structures  
- 🔐 The foundation of cryptography's number-theoretic puzzles  
- ∞ An "upside-down pyramid" (per Ian Stewart) every mastered concept reveals vaster landscapes  

**Goal**: Earn a PhD in mathematics, contribute to original research (especially in algebraic geometry/cryptography), and become a professor who makes advanced concepts accessible.  

## Academic Journey  

### Current Focus  
- Pursuing undergraduate research opportunities at Tulane  
- Exploring seminars and connecting with faculty/grad students  

### Strengths  
- **Independent learning**: Currently reading Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry, by Miles Reid 
- **Teaching**: Lead study groups; find joy in breaking down complex proofs, and teaching

## Hobbies & Adventures  

When I'm not immersed in equations:  
- 🧗 **Rock climbing** (knot theory in action, lol.)  
- ☕ **Coffee alchemy** (optimizing extraction variables)  
- 📚 **Reading** 
- ⛷️ **Skiing** (contour maps)  
- 🛶 **Canoeing** (fluid dynamics)  
- ✈️ **Traveling** (especially to mountains with good coffee shops)  

## YouTube Channels I Love
