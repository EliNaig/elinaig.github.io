Hi, I’m Eli, a first-year mathematics student at Tulane University with a deep passion for learning and discovery. Mathematics is my lens for exploring the world, and I’m eager to channel this perspective into research and real-world problem-solving. My goal is to collaborate with innovative teams where I can use my curiosity and analytical skills to make a positive impact.

When I’m not immersed in equations or theories, you’ll likely find me skiing down slopes, scaling rock walls, rowing on the water, or perfecting my craft as a coffee enthusiast.
