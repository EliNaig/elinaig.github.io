## Overview

I’m a mathematics student at Tulane University with interests in **algebraic coding theory**, **algebraic geometry**, and **cryptography**. I enjoy research problems that connect abstract structure to computation and applications.

{% include feature_row %}

## Research Interests

- Algebraic coding theory (and related computational questions)
- Algebraic geometry (schemes, varieties, and moduli — learning-focused)
- Number theory and cryptography

## Current

- Undergraduate research with [Mahir Bilen Can](https://www2.tulane.edu/~mcan/)
- Coursework and seminar participation in pure and applied mathematics
- Building reproducible computational workflows (Python/R) for math and data
