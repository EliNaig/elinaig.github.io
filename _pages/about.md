# About Me  

**Hello!** I'm Eli Naig, a first-year mathematics student at Tulane University who sees math as more than a subject—it's the lens through which I uncover patterns in everything, from the physics of climbing ropes to the geometry of ski slopes. Like Feynman, I'm driven by the urgency of discovery: *"I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there."*  

## Why Math?  

To me, mathematics is:  
- 🔍 A language of abstract beauty and real-world impact  
- 🌐 The framework connecting algebraic geometry's schemes to tangible structures  
- 🔐 The foundation of cryptography's number-theoretic puzzles  
- ∞ An "upside-down pyramid" (per Ian Stewart)—every mastered concept reveals vaster landscapes  

**Goal**: Earn a PhD in mathematics, contribute to original research (especially in algebraic geometry/cryptography), and become a professor who makes advanced concepts accessible.  

## Academic Journey  

### Current Focus  
- Pursuing undergraduate research opportunities at Tulane  
- Exploring seminars and connecting with faculty/grad students  

### Strengths  
- **Independent learning**: Self-taught set theory, solved Olympiad problems late into the night  
- **Teaching**: Lead study groups; find joy in breaking down complex proofs (tutoring = my secret mastery tool!)  

## Hobbies & Adventures  

When I'm not immersed in equations:  
- 🧗 **Rock climbing** (knot theory in action!)  
- ☕ **Coffee alchemy** (optimizing extraction variables ≈ solving PDEs)  
- 📚 **Reading** (Hartshorne's *Algebraic Geometry* + sci-fi like *Project Hail Mary*)  
- ⛷️ **Skiing** (contour maps = applied calculus)  
- 🛶 **Canoeing** (where fluid dynamics meets serenity)  
- ✈️ **Traveling** (especially to mountains with good coffee shops)  

## YouTube Channels I Love  

| Channel | Why I Love It |
|---------|--------------|
| Numberphile & 3Blue1Brown | Mind-bending math visuals |
| Lex Fridman Podcast | Deep dives into academia |
| Coffee Chronicler | Because coffee is math too |

## Fun Extras  

- **Plant jungle**: My workspace ([photo](#)) is half books, half succulents  
- **Adventure journal**: Sketches + equations + coffee stains = my analog GitHub  
- **Currently reading**: *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves* (Silverman) + *The Three-Body Problem* (Liu)
